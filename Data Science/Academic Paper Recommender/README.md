# Academic Paper Recommender System
## Summary
&nbsp; In this project, I am going to explore different methods of Feature Engineering and see how they affect the result of our model. An Item-based recommender system will be built using a subsample of the Microsoft Academic Graph dataset.

## Item-Based Collaborative Filtering
&nbsp;Item-based collaborative filtering provides recommendations based on the similarity between items. This works in two stages: first finding the similarity scores between items, then ranking all scores to find the top-N similar item recommendations.
