# Logistic Regression
   ## Introduction
Here we have a classification problem; developing a classifier which assigns a random example X (possibly unseen) a class label
Y . In summary, in discriminative modeling assume we have a data set D = {(Xi, Yi), i: 1,2,...,N}. we are choosing a family of hypothesis H for conditional distribution, we First we consider the case where Y = {0,1}.
