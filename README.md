# Python

In this repository, you will find some of the projects I have done in Python. Deep Learning focuses on modeling. At any project, first I tried to explain the math behind the models and then changed parameters and hyperparameters of the model to get the best results.

  The Data Science folder contains the data science projects from data preparation, EDA, and feature engineering to modeling. The main focus here is on providing insights from data. <br/>
