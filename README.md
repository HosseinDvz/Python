# Python

In this repository, you will find some of the projects I have done in Python. Deep Learning focuses on modeling. At any project, first I tried to explain the math behind the models and then changed parameters and hyperparameters of the model to get the best results. In most cases, data was already prepared for modeling.

  The Data Science folder contains the data science projects from data preparation, EDA, and feature engineering to modeling. The main focus here is on providing insights from data, the modeling has the second degree of importance here. I have used some classical machine learning models here; they were enough for the purpose of these projects. Just for the first project, I used deep learning models (CNN, LSTM) in Pytorch.
